# fake-news-generator-and-detector-using-generative-AI-and-NLP

This project focuses on identifying fake news and generating realistic news using Generative AI models and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- ✅ Detect whether a news article is *fake or real*
- ✅ Generate realistic news using *Generative AI models*
- ✅ Understand and apply *NLP techniques*

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- NLP (Natural Language Processing)
- Generative AI (Text generation)

---

## 📁 Dataset Used

- *fake-and-real-news.csv*  
  Dataset contains real and fake news articles with labels for classification.

---

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. *Data Preprocessing* – Cleaning text data
2. *Feature Extraction* – Using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer
3. *Model Building* – Classification using logistic regression, naive bayes etc.
4. *Text Generation* – Using generative model (e.g., GPT or RNN)
5. *Evaluation* – Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, etc.
